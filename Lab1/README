tb_aes_top      -> Simulation Top File
Cipher.autotb.v -> Main Top File
uart*           -> All the files for UART communication
SevenSegTop.vhd -> To display the result on Seven Segment. It also uses Hex2SevenSegConverter.vhd
AESL_automem_RoundKey.v -> The Expanded round key. The mem stores the Key values. Copy the file or modify your file according to this one.
AESL_automem_state.v    -> The plaintext input. The mem stores the input values. Copy the file or modify your file according to this one.

nexus4_ddr.xdc  -> Constraint file. For the Basys, use the file from the previous course.

--------------------------
For the following files, perform the Export IP in Vivado HLS. Select Synthesis and Place&Route. Take the file from sim/IP folder.
Cipher.v -> Top File.
AddRoundKey.v, SubBytes.v, SubBytes_sbox.v


Procedue:
Run the Simulation, Synthesis and C/RTL cosimulation in Vivado HLS for Cipher and InvCipher from AES..
Do 'Export RTL'
Go to the solution1(or name of your solution)/sim/ip. Take the Zip file. 
Create an RTL project in Vivado and add the extracted files from Zip.
Change the SubBytes_sbox.v: line 24.
Add all the above files. tb_aes_top.v should be added as simulation file. This is used for behavioural simulation.
Add the constraint file to run on FPGA.
